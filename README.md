This is an edit and reupload of Cosminpop's LootRes addon with focus on compatability with Raidres on TurtleWOW. Credit to Cosminpop for the original addon.

Changes:

LootLC component fully removed.
Rolling functionallity of addon removed.
Made a small improvement to the creation of table for reserves. 2SR+ now properly works, player's second SR has an "S" appended to the end.
